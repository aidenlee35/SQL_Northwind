# SQL_Northwind

Welcome to my SQL portfolio.  In this repository, you'll find a collection of SQL projects and scripts to showcase my proficiency in database management, query, and data analysis.  Feel free to dive in, explore the code, and get a glimpse into my SQL skills.  If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.  Thank you for visiting!

## Setup
The development of this portfolio was done by using local machine as a server.  To get the development environment setup, you will need to download SQL Server Developer from: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads.

Once the download is completed, the server should be configured locally.  The user name is your computer name.  The server name can be set to your preference.
